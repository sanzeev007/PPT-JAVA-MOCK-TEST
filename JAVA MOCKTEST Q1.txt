1. Create a superclass called Animal with a method makeSound() that prints the sound made by the animal. 
Implement subclasses Dog, Cat, and Cow that inherit from the Animal class. 
Implement the makeSound() method in each subclass to print the sound made by a dog, cat, and cow, respectively.

class Animal {

    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Sound method of parent class");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {

    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dogs bark");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {

    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Cats meow");
    }
}

class Cow extends Animal {

    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Cow Moo");
    }
}

class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        Cat cat = new Cat();
        Cow cow = new Pig();

        dog.printSound();
        cat.printSound();
        cow.printSound();
    }
}
